Certainly! Here's the adjusted formatting for the instructions:

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js installed on your machine

**1. Install Express:**
```bash
npm install express
```

**2. Install Nodemon globally:**
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
Or locally, if you have issues:
```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

**3. Add a start script in your package.json file:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

**4. Install PostgreSQL or any other supported database management system.**

**5. Installing PostgreSQL and Setting Up the Database:**

- Install the `pg` library, which allows your Node.js application to interact with PostgreSQL.
```bash
npm install pg
```

**6. Installing Sequelize:**
```bash
npm install --save sequelize sequelize-cli pg-hstore
```

**7. Installation:**
- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Install the dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

**8. Configure the database connection:**
- Open the `config/config.js` file and update the `development` object with your PostgreSQL database credentials, including the username, password, host, port, and database details.

**9. Set up the database tables:**
- Run the following command to create the necessary tables:
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

**10. Usage:**
- Run the application with the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will start and connect to the PostgreSQL database using the provided configuration.

**Endpoints:**
The application provides the following endpoints:
- GET `/api/recipes`: Retrieve all recipes.
- GET `/api/recipes/:id`: Retrieve a specific recipe by its ID.
- POST `/api/recipes`: Create a new recipe. Provide the recipe data in the request body.
- PUT `/api/recipes/:id`: Update an existing recipe. Provide the updated recipe data in the request body.
- DELETE `/api/recipes/:id`: Delete a recipe by its ID.

Make sure to replace `/api/recipes` with the appropriate route base path if you have configured a different base path in your application.

**Data Validation:**
The application utilizes Sequelize's built-in validation methods to enforce data validation rules. Each field in the model definition includes validation rules that ensure the data meets specific criteria.

For example, the "title" field may be defined with a minimum length rule as follows:
```javascript
title: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING,
  allowNull: false,
  validate: {
    notEmpty: {
      msg: 'Title is required.',
    },
    lessThanThreeChar(value) {
      if (value.length < 3) {
        throw new Error('Title cannot be less than 3 characters.');
      }
    }
  }
},
```

This rule ensures that the "title" field is required and has a minimum length of 3 characters. If the validation fails, Sequelize will throw a validation error with the specified error message.

Feel free to modify the validation rules according to your application's requirements.

**Conclusion:**
With this application, you can leverage Sequelize to perform efficient CRUD operations on your PostgreSQL database while benefiting from built-in data validation capabilities. By following the setup instructions and utilizing the provided endpoints, you can create, retrieve, update, and delete data with confidence in the validation rules enforced by Sequelize.

Happy coding!
